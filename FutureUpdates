# MOUSE CONTROL FUNCTIONS
Implementing a mouse control feature that allows the user to drag block pieces inside the border, using "R" or Up arrow to rotate the block piece.
 Adding a MOUSE_CHAOS event that when enabled, makes tetris pieces move outside the border and a new block spawns in place relative to the position of where the previous block went out of bounds.

# Fixing slider functionality
 As the sliders currently do nothing I need to utilize a preview screen that shows the updated brightness screen and sound preview for volume



# Wobbly Window 
- Adding a feature that when dragged, the game window wiggles around similar to the KDE plasma windows
