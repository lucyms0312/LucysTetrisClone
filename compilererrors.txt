WOOHOO!! NO ERRORS FOUND, you're doing fantastic!



    Now you're on your own. 
       you'll need to figure out any errors that occur from here on out.

       You can use the following resoures to help you:
        - compile.sh: This script will compile the game and logs any errors to the compilererror.txt file
        it then proceeds to add to TODO_tetris_fixes.txt with a description and steps to fix the errors. The errors should be simplified, if not I will fix that
