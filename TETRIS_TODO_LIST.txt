TODO List for Tetris Clone Fixes and Enhancements:

[ ] 1. Fix the _USE_MATH_DEFINES macro usage and include order to resolve SFML errors related to BlendMode.
   - Current code has "Define _USE_MATH_DEFINES" instead of "#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES".
   - Ensure proper placement before including <cmath> or <math.h>.

[ ] 2. Replace font.loadFromFile() calls with font.openFromFile() as SFML Font class uses openFromFile().

[ ] 3. Add #include <fstream> to main.cpp to fix incomplete type errors for std::ifstream and std::ofstream.

[ ] 4. Declare and define the loadCoins and saveCoins methods properly inside the TetrisApp class.

[ ] 5. Ensure the loadCoins method is called before resetting the game and changing the game state.

[ ] 6. Ensure the saveCoins method is called when exiting the game or returning to the main menu.
- (This is not necesssary for the current version as there's really nothing cool to buy in the shop yet)
[ ] 7. Verify that the coin display updates correctly on both the game screen and main menu.
[ ] 8. Add an extra mod class to fix sand grains from breaking the game, ensure sand class is only called when needed.
[ ] 9. Test shop purchase actions to deduct coins and update the background color.

Next Steps:
[ ] 10. Fix the macro definition line.
[ ]  11. Replace font loading calls.
[ ]  12. Add missing include.
(will check on this error later as it's not critical)
[x] 13. Implement load/save coin methods.
[ ] 14. Test all coin-related features.

This file will be used as a reference to complete the task efficiently instead of manually checking each error when compiling.
(This file will become blank after all tasks are completed, will update with new tasks as needed)
Compilation Bugs (Critical - Prevent Building):
[ ] 1. Missing closing brace for TetrisApp class - error: expected ‘}’ at end of input.
(not critical, game still functions)
[ ] 2. Steps: Add the missing '};' at the end of the class definition.

[ ] 3. Invalid function definitions inside handleEvents() method.
   - update() function defined inside handleEvents() at line ~847.
   - draw() function defined inside handleEvents() at line ~873.
   - Steps: Move update() and draw() function definitions outside of handleEvents(), as member functions of TetrisApp.

[ ] 4. 'update' and 'draw' not declared in scope within run() method.
   - Steps: Ensure update() and draw() are properly declared as private member functions in the class.

[ ] 5. Function-definition not allowed before ‘{’ token in handleEvents().
   - Steps: Remove the erroneous function definitions from inside handleEvents().

[ ] 6. Expected unqualified-id at end of input.
   - Steps: Fix the class structure and ensure no stray code outside the class.

Next Steps for Compilation Fixes:
[ ] Review the class structure and ensure all braces are balanced.
[ ] Move misplaced function definitions to the correct location.
