TODO List for Tetris Clone Fixes and Enhancements:
# THIS IS AN OPEN SOURCE CODE, FEEL FREE TO CLONE MY REPO AND EDIT IT YOUR OWN WAY, IF YOU WANT ME TO FEATURE IT ON MY GITHUB/A FUTURE DISCORD SERVER, PLEASE CONTACT ME ON DISCORD AT:
       <span style="color:red;">@luxifer_ms03.</span>
[ ] 1. Fix the _USE_MATH_DEFINES macro usage and include order to resolve SFML errors related to BlendMode.
   - Current code has "Define _USE_MATH_DEFINES" instead of "#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES".
   - Ensure proper placement before including <cmath> or <math.h>.

[ ] 2. Replace font.loadFromFile() calls with font.openFromFile() as SFML Font class uses openFromFile().

[ ] 3. Add #include <fstream> to main.cpp to fix incomplete type errors for std::ifstream and std::ofstream.

Next Steps:
- Fix the macro definition line.
- Replace font loading calls.
- Add missing include.

This file will be used as a reference to complete the task systematically.

Compilation Bugs (Critical - Prevent Building):
[ ] 1. Missing closing brace for TetrisApp class - error: expected ‘}’ at end of input.
   - Steps: Add the missing '};' at the end of the class definition.

[ ] 2. Invalid function definitions inside handleEvents() method.
   - update() function defined inside handleEvents() at line ~847.
   - draw() function defined inside handleEvents() at line ~873.
   - Steps: Move update() and draw() function definitions outside of handleEvents(), as member functions of TetrisApp.

[ ] 3. 'update' and 'draw' not declared in scope within run() method.
   - Steps: Ensure update() and draw() are properly declared as private member functions in the class.

[ ] 4. Function-definition not allowed before ‘{’ token in handleEvents().
   - Steps: Remove the erroneous function definitions from inside handleEvents().

[ ] 5. Expected unqualified-id at end of input.
   - Steps: Fix the class structure and ensure no stray code outside the class.

Next Steps for Compilation Fixes:
- Review the class structure and ensure all braces are balanced.
- Move misplaced function definitions to the correct location.
- Recompile after fixes to verify no syntax errors.

[ ] SFML Text objects cannot be default constructed in optional wrappers.
- Change std::optional<sf::Text> to sf::Text and initialize in constructor.

[ ] setIcon function signature mismatch.
- Use sf::Vector2u for size parameter: window.setIcon(sf::Vector2u(icon.getSize().x, icon.getSize().y), icon.getPixelsPtr());

[ ] setPosition expects Vector2f, not separate ints.
- Update all setPosition calls to use sf::Vector2f(x, y) instead of (x, y).


# ONLY PROCEED WITH THE NEXT TAKSKS ONCE YOU ARE READY

[X]  # BIGGEST PROJECT EVER:
   [] - create a backup of the main.cpp file
      [] - Pay attention to code and find a more human approach to writing the script
